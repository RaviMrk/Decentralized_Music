    "- Streaming services allow artists to be independent from a record label\n",
    "- However, there's a problem with the amount the artists are actually paid per stream (very little)\n",
    "- Each of these streaming services make on average of 1.6 million dollars a day\n",
    "- However, the artist only receives 25% of that revenue\n",

    "- This way the web app is uncensorable. A user can use the front-end, but if taken down, can access the backend directly via terminal, metamask, etc. \n",
    "- The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) acts as a database for primitive data types and transaction logic.\n",
    "- Since gas costs a lot, the author limited the apps usage of the EVM to solely transaction logic\n",
    "- Audio files are stored on IPFS, referenced via the ethereum blockchain. \n",
    "- The web app is designed to be hosted on a server running an IPFS daemon. It expects artists to pin data to their own servers. \n",

    "- Storage layer is IPFS. Logic layer needed for artist compensation, securing ownership + trade of songs. \n",

    "- Any entity can set up and run a server, but that doesn’t mean that everyone else is going to trust that entity.\n",
    "-  Each node communicates with one another and accepts verification and reaches consensus every 2–5 seconds with other trusted peers. \n",

    "- The end result is completely synced ledger every 2–5 seconds.\n",
    "- Basically, numerous nodes across the network vote in order to create consensus, and the voting gives more bias towards trusted nodes.\n",

    "- Someone recently was selling shares of his goat farm in the Dominican Republic on the SDEX.\n",
    "-  There’s a secondary usage to lumens as well — they serve as an anti-spam mechanism because each transaction on the lumen network has a minor fee. This helps to mitigate DoS (Denial of Service) attacks by limiting the volume of fake transactions that try to flood the system.\n",

    "- Stellar Wind transforms the activity on the Stellar Network into harmonic musical art by mapping every transaction to a musical note depending on the relative height of the transaction amount.\n",
    "-  It is intended to be kept open in a browser tab to listen to for relaxation, coding or any other activity requiring calmness and focus.\n",
    "-  The data for Stellar Wind to compose music is streamed from the Horizon API server.\n",
    "- It captures all occurring transactions and stores all non zero amounts from operations in the network.\n",
    "- Those amounts are taken off a queue in regular intervals and used as normalized inputs for the music composition.\n",
    "- Stellar Wind uses tone.js to play music. To create interesting melodies, notes are picked from a C-minor pentatonic scale with an added A flat. (that adds some interesting colors) ;\n",
